# Changelog

## Version 2.0.0

- Specification: AR_COMPONENT is a block enclosed in /begin and /end, not a keyword
- Specification: The integer value in a STRUCTURE_COMPONENT should be called "address_offset" instead of "size"
- Specification: The proc macro specification has been replaced with the code generated by the macro.
  This provides no direct benefit, but allows rust-analyzer to understand all of a2lfile.
- Cleanup: References from TYPEDEF_AXIS to RECORD_LAYOUT are now taken into account, so that used RECORD_LAYOUTs are not removed
- Cleanup: References from STATUS_STRING_REF to COMPU_METHOD are now taken into account, so that used COMPU_METHODs are not removed
- Documentation: The type of log_msgs is now correctly shown als A2lError instead of String
- Misc: Improved tests
- Misc: Updated github workflows
- Misc: Apache2 and MIT license files were added to the repository
